# ClinicalTrials.gov data engineering and analysis workflow

This repository contains all the code and files necessary to render the [Analyzing all the clinical trials started between 2010-2021 that match Novartis’s therapeutic areas](https://gmrobles.quarto.pub/clinicaltrialsgov-analysis/) article.

This analysis has been developed as a fun weekend project to showcase my data science skills, with an emphasis on data engineering and visualization with R. Using data obtained through ClinicalTrials.gov’s API, I show how to set up a robust and modern data analysis pipeline in a short amount of time to get immediate and (hopefully) visually appealing results.
